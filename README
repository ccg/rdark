This fork makes the Visual (selected) text highlighting much easier to see.

It removes the rdark_current_line config variable in favor of simply
configuring the CursorLine color directly. That way, you can activate the
cursorline setting later and still have the appropriate color.

It also sets the CursorColumn color the same as CursorLine.
